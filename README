CovidHelper is a solution to help small to medium sized medical institutions to keep a record of patient Covid-19 vaccinations.
If you work in a location that at least has access to a reasonably basic PC or Linux computer and have, somewhere, the ability to download from the Internet - then you can use CovidHelper.

CovidHelper is designed for medical institutions that need a quick resource that is realiable and easy to use.

Features include:
- Automatic database setup (requires the initial creation of one database)
- Permissions to control access to records and protected system pages
- Written in PHP, HTML and JavaScript: no complicated technologies or frameworks that are hard to learn or maintain
- Uses MySQL
- Can be run locally on a single computer, if needed

CovidHelper is currently in development.
